Remember food intake requirements vary depending on age, activity and environment, and should be adjusted accordingly.Feeding weaning pups: puppies start to nibble on solid foods at 3 - 4 weeks of age. Keep moistened Purina¨ Dog Chow¨ (three parts kibble to one part water) available to puppies at all times until fully weaned (6 - 8 weeks of age).Feeding growing pups: after weaning, Purina¨ Dog Chow¨ can be fed moistened or dry at the same time every day-very young puppies three times a day, older puppies twice a day. Use the feeding guidelines shown here, but remember individual needs can vary. Feed to maintain ideal body condition as shown on the back panel. Slight appetite changes and occasional digestive upsets are normal in puppies. If upsets become severe or linger longer than a day or two, contact your veterinarian.Feeding for reproduction: Purina¨ Dog Chow¨ provides the extra nutrition needed by reproducing females in stages of gestation and lactation. Food consumption may vary during gestation, so feed the amount needed to maintain the pregnant female's good body condition. Food intake may double or even quadruple during lactation.Switching to Purina¨ Dog Chow¨: when switching to Purina¨ Dog Chow¨ from another food, please allow 7 - 10 days for the transition. Gradually add more Purina¨ Dog Chow¨ and less of the previous food to your pet's dish each day until the changeover is complete. This gradual transition will help avoid dietary upsets.Provide adequate fresh water in a clean container daily.For your pet's health, see your veterinarian regularly.Recommended daily feeding amounts - using a standard 8-oz measuring cup.Adult god size (lbs) - feeding amount (cups).3 - 12 - 1/3 to 1.13 - 20 - 1 to 1-1/3.21 - 35 - 1-1/3 to 2.38 - 50 - 2 to 2-2/3.51 - 75 - 2-2/3 to 3-1/3.76 - 100 - 3-1/3 to 4-1/4.Over 100 - 4-1/4 cups plus 1/4 cup for each 10 lbs of body weight over 100 lbs.Feed to ideal body condition.Too thin ribs are highly visible.

Flour is bleached to improve color and baking performance. This process does not affect the nutritional value of the flour.What is the best way to store all purpose flour?Store flour in an airtight container in a cool place (75 degrees F or cooler) away from heat. For maximum shelf life, flour may be stored in refrigerator or freezer. If stored correctly, flour will stay fresh up to 2 years.If my recipe calls for sifting, do I need to sift?No! Pillsbury Best¨ all purpose flour is sifted over 100 times so it is appropriate for all recipes whether they call for sifted flour or not. However, shipping and storage may have caused settling of the flour so it is always a good practice to loosen the flour with a fork or spoon before measuring.What flours can I substitute with all purpose flour?All purpose and unbleached all purpose flour can be used interchangeably. If the recipe calls for self rising flour, simply add 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt for every cup of all purpose flour substituted in the recipe.How many cups per pound of flour?There are about 3 1/2 cups of flour in 1 pound.",,"Bleached Wheat Flour, Malted Barley Flour (Improves Yeast Baking), Niacin, Iron, Thiamin Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,013000798204,138,27469,00013000798204,722e68e0-4d1d-11e1-a2c8-005056957023,1,H.J.

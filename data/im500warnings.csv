If ingested, drink water. If discomfort occurs or persists, contact your doctor or veterinarian.Winter Melt* ice melter may be used to remove snow and ice from concrete sidewalks, parking lots and asphalt surfaces. However, all ice-melting agents work by reducing the freezing point of water. This may result in more frequent freeze-thaw cycling of the melted snow and ice, which can cause surface scaling of concrete. As such, use only on properly placed, cured and sealed, air-entrained concrete. To lessen the possibility of freeze-thaw cycling and potential damage, promptly remove slush as it is formed. Do not use on porous or improperly cured concrete, concrete less than one year old, precast concrete items, masonry, mortar, wood or other porous materials. As with any ice-melting agent, particular care should be used when grass and vegetation are adjacent to the deicing surface as excess application may cause damage.Consumer uses this product at his/her own risk."070575040091,100,102410,00070575040091,d0291470-de96-11e2-a2d2-005056ab0051,"Contains: soy, wheat, milk."024000322306,101,108020,00024000322306,11396350-f95b-11e2-9937-005056ab0051,Contains: Wheat.051500766422,104,97625,00051500766422,fe4693b0-5f0c-11e1-a6a8-005056957023,"Contains wheat ingredients.May contain milk and soybean ingredients."071300000762,105,51798,00071300000762,d9119340-9e9c-11e1-a291-005056ab0051,Allergen Information: Contains Wheat ingredients and is manufactured in a facility that uses Eggs.016000197268,106,134396,00016000197268,6aeccf50-7d35-11e3-8545-005056ab0051,Contains wheat; may contain milk ingredients.027700548755,107,104943,00027700548755,aec0e6d0-ea5a-11e2-8c22-005056ab0051,Contains: Wheat and milk.013000798006,108,27416,00013000798006,72488b20-4d1e-11e1-a2c8-005056957023,"Contains wheat, milk, soybeans.Safety button.

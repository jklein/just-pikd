For years, making stock from scratch has been the only way health conscious cooks have been able to control and limit ingredients, such as salts and chemicals.But who has the time to make stock from scratch?In 1996, we were the first to introduce ready to use cooking stocks. Our stocks are slowly simmered from meat, vegetables and herbs, without added or produced MSG, additives or excess salts.We know that it's hard to make healthy food choices with confidence. So, this all-natural, rich-tasting, gluten-free chicken stock is now certified by the American Heart Association which gives shoppers confidence that this product has been screened and verified to meet the American Heart Association's certification criteria to be low in saturated fat and cholesterol for healthy people over age 2.Usage ideas.

For years, making stock from scratch has been the only way health conscious cooks have been able to control and limit ingredients, such as salts and chemicals.But who has the time to make stock from scratch?In 1996, we were the first to introduce ready-to-use cooking stocks. Our stocks are slowly simmered for that dark-rich taste and made naturally from meat, vegetables and herbs, without added or produced MSG, additives or excess salts.We know that it's hard to make healthy food choices with confidence. So, this all-natural, rich-tasting, gluten-free unsalted chicken stock is now certified by the American Heart Association which gives shoppers confidence that this product has been screened and verified to meet the American Heart Association's certification criteria to be low in saturated fat and cholesterol for healthy people over age 2.Our pledge: guaranteed satisfaction.

It is used by many to flavor vegetables, potatoes and rice dishes. For years, making stock from scratch has been the only way health conscious cooks have been able to control and limit ingredients, such as salts and chemicals.But who has the time to make stock from scratch?In 1996, we were the first to introduce ready to use cooking stocks. Our stocks are slowly simmered from meat, vegetables and herbs, without added or produced MSG, additives or excess salts.We know that it's hard to make healthy food choices with confidence. So, this all-natural, rich-tasting, gluten-free beef stock is now certified by the American Heart Association which gives shoppers confidence that this product has been screened and verified to meet the American Heart Association's certification criteria to be low in saturated fat and cholesterol for healthy people over age 2.Usage ideas.Use in any recipe calling for broth, stock, bouillon or water.For more usage ideas visit www.kitchenbasics.net.Founder Paul Hamerly with Chef & VP product development Ed Marlier.Dark rich.While many factors affect heart disease, diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of this disease.Compare stock & Broth*.This stock contains 5g protein vs. the leading broth at 2g and it has less than half the sodium at 430mg vs. the leading broth at 890mg (per cup).Eatingwell.com.Recipe courtesy of eatingwell.com.For other fantastic heart healthy recipes visit www.kitchenbasics.net/hearthealthy.Recyclable only where facilities exist.To find out, visit: www.recyclecartons.com.Protects.Tetra Pak.What's good&#153;.Tetra Brik&#174;Aseptic.Tetra Park.www.tetrapakusa.comOur pledge.Guaranteed satisfaction.

Annie's shells & white cheddar. After twenty years, our beloved purple box remains our rock-a link from the past to the present. We're proud to now bring you the same delicious recipe with certified organic pasta.So why such a positive response to our purple box from the start? The color purple proves to be eye-catching together with our logo-the quirky, smiling rabbit (not seal) of approval my brother sketched from a photo of Bernie, my pet rabbit. Maybe it's our distinctively delicious, all-natural, ground-breaking white cheddar cheese or those unique cheddar-catching pasta shells. Perhaps above all, Annie's founding mission to make the planet a greener, healthier place resonates with you. All of these answers contribute to the perseverance of our purple box. But I believe that you, our friends and customers, are the real magic behind the brand.We're honored that you've let us grow with your families, and that you continue to recommend Annie's to your family, friends, and roommates.
